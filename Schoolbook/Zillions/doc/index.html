<h1>Introduction</h1>

<a href="http://www.samiam.org/chessvariants/">Schoolbook</a> is my take on 8x10 chess with the rook + knight and bishop +
knight pieces added.  While <A href=http://www.chessvariants.org/historic.dir/carrera.html>a</A> <A href=http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/bird.html>number</A> <A href=http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/capablanca.html>of</A> <A href=http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/capablancavariation.html>different </A> <A href=http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/grotesque.html>opening</A> <A href=http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/univers.html>setups</A> using
these pieces and board <A href=http://play.chessvariants.org/pbm/presets/embassy.html>have</A> <A href=http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/ladorean_chess.html>been</A> <A href=http://www.chessvariants.org/d.betza/chessvar/outrig.html>proposed</A>, I have not been completely satisfied 
with any of them.  My goal, in designing Schoolbook, was to come
up with an 8x10 opening setup with the following characteristics:

<ul>
<li>All of the pawns are defended in the opening array; as many pieces as
    possible are defended in the opening array.
<li>The development of the knights and bishops resembles their development
    in FIDE chess; other arrays seem to be detrimental.  For example,
    some 8x10 arrays have it so moving the center pawns two squares forward
    blocks the development of the bishops.
<li>The rooks are placed in the corners, and the king is centrally placed. 
    This makes the opening setup more ascetically pleasing.
</ul>

There are two opening setups which meet this criteria.  I chose the one 
where white's queen is left of his king, since this allows a right-side
castle to be done more quickly, and since this preserves the traditional
idea of having a "king side" and a "queen side".

<p>

Schoolbook is for people who like 19th century tactical chess.  By
putting the archbishop in the center like that results in having the
archbishop pawn undefended when moved forward two squares.  This results
in the kind of intensely tactical games that Morphy or Anderssen played.
1. d4 in FIDE chess was very uncommon (Morphy only opened with 1. e4 and
always responded to 1. e4 with 1. ... e5) and Morphy once said that the
Sicilian results in "uninteresting games and dreary analytical labours".

<p>

Schoolbook is designed to play sharp games where tactics is King (or
at least checkmates the other King) and where games are interesting and
never dreary, while keeping the general feel of FIDE games.

<p>

The name "schoolbook" comes from the recent tradition of naming 8x10
chess variants after fonts.

<h1>Setup</h1>

Schoolbook chess' opening setup is as follows:

<p>
<script type=text/javascript>
<!-- 
function isOKbrowser() {

  if(navigator.appVersion.indexOf) {
      if(navigator.appName == "Netscape" && 
         navigator.appVersion.indexOf("4") == 0 &&
         navigator.userAgent.indexOf("MSIE") == -1) {
            return false;
         }
      if(navigator.appName == "Netscape" && 
         navigator.appVersion.indexOf("3") == 0 &&
         navigator.userAgent.indexOf("MSIE") == -1) {
            return false;
         }
      if(navigator.appName == "Microsoft Internet Explorer" && 
         navigator.appVersion.indexOf("MSIE 4") != -1) {
            return false;
         }
      return true;
  }	
  
  return true;
}
if(isOKbrowser()) { 
document.write("<img class=print src=setup-bw.png>");
}
document.write("<img class=screen src=setup-rustic.png>");
-->
</script>

<h1>Pieces</h1>

<h2>Names of the pieces</h2>

R: Rook.  Moves as a Chess rook; the only difference is in how this piece may castle.
<p>
Q: Queen.  Identical to a chess queen.
<p>
N: kNight.  Identical to a chess knight.
<p>
B: Bishop.  Identical to a chess bishop.
<p>
K: King.  Moves a a Chess king; object is to checkmate this piece.  The only difference is how this piece castles.
<p>
A: Archbishop.  Has the combined moves of a knight and bishop.
<p>
M: Marshall.  Has the combined moves of a knight and rook.
<p>
<h2>Value of the pieces</h2>
A lot of research has been done in determining the values of the pieces
in 8x10 chess variants with the rook + knight and bishop + knight pieces.
Schoolbook is able to utilize the fruits of this research.

<p>

Here is a table of five different derived values for the pieces, obtained 
from three different chess variant playing computer programs and 
two other sources.

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Piece</td><td>ChessV</td><td>SMIRF</td><td>Zillions</td><td>Aberg</td><td>Nalls</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Pawn            </td><td>1.000</td><td>1.000</td><td>1.000</td><td>1.000</td><td>1.000</td></tr><tr><td>
Knight         </td><td>2.500</td><td>3.053</td><td>2.362</td><td>3.000</td><td>3.077</td></tr><tr><td>

Rook            </td><td>4.700</td><td>5.815</td><td>4.262</td><td>5.000</td><td>5.777</td></tr><tr><td>
Queen          </td><td>8.750</td><td>9.617</td><td>7.060</td><td>9.000</td><td>9.312</td></tr><tr><td>

Marshall       </td><td>8.250</td><td>8.870</td><td>6.659</td><td>8.700</td><td>8.854</td></tr></table>

<p>
The ChessV numbers were obtained by looking at the source code for ChessV.
The SMIRF values, derived by Reinhard Scharnagl for his SMIRF chess
computer program, were obtained from 
<A 
href=http://web.archive.org/web/20070409085426/http://www.chessbox.de/Compu/schachveri1_e.html>this web page</A>.
The Zillions of Games' values were obtained by looking at the values of 
pieces by right-clicking on them after loading a fresh Schoolbook zrf file,
and before moving any pieces.  Aberg's figures come from <A
href=http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/capablancavariation.html>the
Chess variants server</A>.   Nalls' figures come from 
<a href="http://www.symmetryperfect.com/shots/values-capa.pdf">a document 
on his web page</a> (PDF document)

<p>

All four agree on the following:

<ul>
<li>A bishop is about a half-pawn more valuable than a knight.
<li>Two knights are worth more than a rook.
<li>An archbishop is worth more than two knights.
<li>A marshall is worth more than an archbishop.
<li>A queen is worth more than a marshall.
<li>Two rooks are worth more than a queen.
<li>A marshall is worth more than a rook and knight.
<li>A marshall is worth more than two bishops.
<li>A rook and knight are worth more than an archbishop.
</ul>

The verdict is still out on some other exchanges:

<ul>
<li>A rook and bishop vs. a queen.
<li>A rook and bishop vs. a marshall.
<li>A bishop and knight vs. an archbishop.
<li>Two bishops vs. an archbishop (Two bishops are <i>probably</i> worth more). 
</ul>

<h1>Rules</h1>

In Schoolbook 2.0, the king always moves three squares towards the rook
when castling.

<p>

In Schoolbook 1.0 Castling comes from Fergus Duniho's <A
href=http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/grotesque.html>Grotesque
Chess</A>: The king may castle two or three squares towards the rook on
the right hand side, and two, three, or four squares towards the rook
on the left hand side.  The rook leaps over the king to land besides the
king.  The king can not castle out of, through, or in to check.  Both the
king and rook that the king castles with must not have previously moved.

<p>

The name of the rook + knight piece in Schoolbook is called the "marshall"
or "marshal".
The name of the bishop + knight piece in Schoolbook is called the
"archbishop".  
Pawns may promote to become a rook, knight, bishop, archbishop, marshall, or queen, regardless of the number of pieces already on the board.

<p>

The notation used for this game is standard algebraic opening, where
the lower left corner is square a1, the upper right corner square j8,
and 'A' signifies the Archbishop and 'M' signifies the Marshall. When no
piece name is specified, a pawn is assumed to move. For example, f4 is
the move that moves the King's pawn to the forth rank. When castling,
only the King's move is noted, such as "Kh1" to signify that the king
has moved to h1 and the rook to g1. In order to minimize the confusion
between "i" and "j", the I file is always upper case in notation.

<p>

The rules are otherwise as in FIDE chess.

<h1>Notes</h1>

<h2>The opening</h2>

The opening of Schoolbook has many similar themes to the opening of
standard international chess, since both games have the knights and bishops in the same
position relative to the king in the opening setup.  There are, however,
a number of differences.  For example:

<ul>
<li>Any opening that is dependent on the queen pawn (which has become
    the archbishop pawn in Schoolbook) being protected by the queen will
    not work in Schoolbook.  This makes the center game, the center
    counter (Scandinavian game), the Scotch game, and so on not translate
    to Schoolbook.  For example, the Schoolbook version of the Scotch just
    loses a pawn without compensation: 1. f4 f5 2. Ng3 Nd6 3. e4?? fxe4
<li>The "Queen's gambit" does not translate to Schoolbook; this "gambit"
    depends on Black's queen rook being undefended in the opening array.  
<li>The Schoolbook equivalent of the Nimzovich defense (1. f4 Nd6) is more 
    feasible here than it is in FIDE chess, since this defense delays white
    making an immediate e4 move.
<li>Openings that take advantage of the weakness with the king bishop
    pawn in standard international Chess do not work in Schoolbook.  For example, the Damiano
    defense is feasible in Schoolbook chess: 1. f4 f5 2. Ng3 g6 3. Nxf5??
    gxf5 4. Ai5+ and now black can defend nicely with either Ag7 or
    h6 (since Af5+ is <i>not</i> a legal move), and white gets no
    compensation for the lost knight.
    <p>
    While this change removes many of the opening traps enjoyed in standard
    international chess, this is offset by the increased power of the pieces in 
    Schoolbook chess.
</ul>

One good opening position for white is as follows:

<p>
<script type=text/javascript>
<!-- 
if(isOKbrowser()) { 
document.write("<img class=print src=opening-bw.png>");
}
document.write("<img class=screen src=opening-rustic.png>");
-->
</script>
<noscript>
<img src=opening-rustic.png>
</noscript>
<p>

<!-- 
This position can also be represented in ASCII:

<pre>
- - - b p p b - - -
p - p n - a n m - -
- p - p q - p p p p
- - - - r r - - k -
</pre>
 -->


Black's goal is to stop this kind of opening setup.  Considering the
tactical power of all of the Schoolbook pieces, Black has many options
to try and equalize.
<p>

For example, the following moves stop 1. f4 from being followed by 2. e4:
Nd6, Af6 (Problem: blocks Black's f pawn), Ad6 (Blocks black's best
developing square for his queenside Knight), f5 (the King's pawn
opening Schoolbook-style), d5 (Schoolbook's version of the Sicilian), 
and Ng6 (Schoolbook's version of the Alekine).
<p>

Since Schoolbook has a higher branching factor than standard international chess, rote
memorization of openings is not as fruitful in Schoolbook as it is
in standard chess.  Since the general themes in Schoolbook are the same,
players who understand the concepts behind a good opening in standard chess
will feel right at home playing Schoolbook.

<p>

More information about the Schoolbook opening can be found in
the <A href=opening-theory/opening.html>opening theory document</A>.

<h2>Tactics</h2>

A sense of Schoolbook's tactics can be gleamed by solving the <A 
href=mates/mates.html>included mating problems</A>, which are
not composed problems, but positions from actual games of Schoolbook.
One may also look at some <A href="../games/zillions_vs_chessv.html">analysis
of Schoolbook games</A>.

<h2>Fool's mate</h2>

The shortest possible game in Schoolbook is the following fool's mate: 
1. f3 Ad6 2. Bf2?? Axh2# 
<p>
David Paulowich found the following 4-move mate that mates with a bishop: 1. e4 g6 2. f4 Kg7? 3. Bf2 Kh6?? 4. Bi5#


<h2>Intellectual property claims</h2>

I make no intellectual property claims whatsoever with this (such as it is) invention.  

<h2>Playing Schoolbook Chess</h2>

This Zillions of Games implementation of Schoolbook chess requires the
proprietary Zillions of game program available at <A 
href=http://www.zillions-of-games.com/>www.zillions-of-games.com</A>.
Note that this implementation does not implement all of the rules of
Schoolbook; in particular the "50 moves without a capture or pawn move
is a draw" rule and the "insufficient mating material is a draw" rules
are not implemented.
<p>

I have made a Game Courier preset which is available <A href=http://play.chessvariants.org/pbm/play.php?game%3DSchoolbook+Chess%26settings%3Ddefault>on
the chessvariants server</A> at play.chessvariants.org.

<p>

<A href="http://www.chessv.com">ChessV</A> version 0.9 and
later can also play Schoolbook.  This is a free open-source Chess playing
program for Windows.
