<h2>An introduction to Schoolbook</h2>

One of the nice things about chess variant design is that it opens up
new fields of opening study to explore.  In FIDE (orthodox, western)
Chess, any move on the first half-dozen turns that is not an outright
blunder has already been throughly studied and explored.  Many opening
lines are 20 or 30 moves deep.  There are little, if any, interesting 
new frontiers to explore.
<p>

Chess variants, however, make it possible for someone to be a trailblazer
again,
exploring openings that have never been studied before.  With
computer assistance, this exploration is easier than ever before.  In
particular, Greg Strong's excellent <A 
href="http://www.chessv.com">ChessV program</A>, in 
addition to being able to play a number of variants, has a "test this
position" feature to help facilitate opening research.

<b>How to play Schoolbook</b><p>
</A>

The Chess variant whose openings that this article will explore 
is my own Schoolbook chess variant, which has the following opening
position:

<p>
<img src="../setup-rustic.png">

<p>
The piece that looks like both a knight and a rook is called a
"Marshall" and can move like either a knight or rook.  The 
corresponding knight + bishop piece is called an "Archbishop".  
Castling is more flexible than in FIDE Chess: The king can move
two, three, or, on the queenside, four squares towards the 
corresponding rook; the rook jump over the kind to land besides
it.

<p>

Schoolbook is a very tactical game that rejuvinates the spirit of
19th century chess, when tactics were king and bold sacrifices were
common.  The knights and bishops are in the same positions relative
to the king as they are in FIDE chess; this means that many opening
patterns in FIDE chess also exist in Schoolbook.

<p>

A note on notation:
The lower left corner square is the a1 square; the upper right
hand corner square is the j8 square.  In order to minimize confusion
between "i" and "j", and second to the right hand file is called the
"I" file instead of the "i" file.  When castling, it is sufficient to 
note only the king's move.  "f4" is moving white's pawn in front 
of the king forward two squares.

<h2>The king's pawn opening</h2>

<A name="1f4f5">
<b>1. f4 f5</b><p>
</A>

Just like in FIDE chess, one of White's best moves is moving the
king's pawn forward two squares.  This is called the "f4" move in
Schoolbook notation.  After <tt>1. f4</tt>, black has a number of
replies, the best probably being <tt>1. ... f5</tt>.  The game,
at this point, can continue a number of ways, including 
<tt>2. Ng3 Nd6 3. Nd3 Ng6</tt>, <tt>2. Nd3 Nd6 3. Ng3 Ng6</tt>, or
<tt>2. Nd3 Ng6 3. Ng3 Nd6</tt>, resulting in the Schoolbook
equivalent of the four knights defense:

<p>

<p>

Another way to continue the game after <tt>2. ... f5</tt> is with
the Schoolbook form of the Bishop's opening, <tt>3. Bd4</tt>.  Black's
best response at this point is probably <tt>3. ... Ng6</tt>, which
results in the following position:

<p>

<img src="kings-bishop01.png">

<p>

White at this point can defend his f pawn with <tt>4. Nd3</tt> or
<tt>4. e3</tt>.

<p>

<A name="marshallspike">
<b>The Marshall Spike</b><p>
</A>

If, instead of <tt>3. ... Ng6</tt>, black opts for the symmetric
<tt>3. ... Bd5</tt>, one reply that White has is called
the <i>Marshall Spike</i>.  This is when either white moves
his Marshall to the h3 square early in the game, or black performs
the corresponding Mh6 move.  The Marshall Spike, when done by
white, threatens the
h7 square.  One reply for black is to move out his marshall to Mh6,
which will result the Marshalls being exchanged and
Black having doubled pawns.  Another reply to the Marshall Spike, which
seems more sensible, is for black to defend his h pawn with h6, which 
results in the following position:

<p>

<img src="kings-bishop02.png"><br>
<i>Position after 1. f4 f5 2. Bd4 Bd5 3. Mh3 h6</i>

<p>

One interesting dynamic in Schoolbook caused by the Marshall Spike is
that it weakens the other player's kingside.  Black will most likely
castle queenside and white will castle kingside in a game with the
above position.  This will result in a dynamic game where both sides can 
use their pawns to attack the other king without weakening their own
king's fortress.

<p>

<A name="1f4Nd6">
<b>The Nimzoesque Defense</b><p>
</A>

Black, naturally, has some other options besides <tt>1. ... f5</tt> when
white opens by pushing out his king pawn.  One reply is the Schoolbook
equivalent to the Nimzowich defense, which I call the <i>Nimzoesque
Defense</i>.  In this defense, black responds to <tt>1. f4</tt> with
<tt>1. ... Nd6</tt>.  Since the centrally placed archbishop doesn't
defend his file the way the centrally placed queen does in FIDE
chess, white can not reply by moving his other central pawn forward
two squares the way he can in FIDE chess.  What white can do, 
however, is push out his king bishop's pawn, resulting in the
following position:

<p>
<img src="nimzoesque01.png">
<br>
<i>The position after 1. f4 Nd6 2. g4</i>
<p>

In the above position, Black can not move out any of his central
pawns two squares until he finds some way to defend them.  Should
black play <tt>2. ... f5</tt>, for example, white can simply respond
with <tt>3. gxf5 Nxf5 4. e4</tt> and now black has to move his
knight a third time in the opening, and white still has control
of the center.

<p>

Another way white can reply to the Nimzoesque Defense is via
<tt>2. Ng3</tt>.  Greg Strong has analysized this position, and 
found the following line: <tt>1. f4 Nd6 2. Ng3 f5 3. Bd4 e6 
4. Nd3 Bf6 5. Ne5 Mh6</tt>.  The position obtained from this
line is as follows:

<p>

<br>
<i>Greg Strong's analysis of the Nimzoesque Defense</i>

<p>
Here we see that it is black who performs a Marshall Spike; white's
best reply is probably h3, although Mh3 is reasonable if White doesn't
mind exchanging off the Marshalls and having doubled pawns.

<b>The Sibahi Defense</b><p>
</A>

Another reply that black has to <tt>1. f4</tt> is to start a queenside
fianchetto with <tt>1. ... c6</tt>.  I call this defense the <i>Sibahi 
Defense</i>, named
after Abdul-Rahman Sibahi, who played this defense against me.  Here is how
this position looks:

<p>

<img src="sibahi01.png">
<br><i>The Sibahi Defense</i>
<p>

As we can see, in this position black immediately applies pressure
on the f pawn with his queen.  Unlike many other openings in 
Schoolbook, the Sibahi Defense puts the queen in to play at
the beginning of the game.  White's best reply appears to be
<tt>2. Nd3</tt>, which develops a piece and defends the f pawn.

<p>

Black will probably, at this point, fianchetto his queenside
bishop with <tt>2. ... Bc7</tt>, which applies more pressure on the f 
pawn.  White, at this point, can defend with either <tt>3. e3</tt> or
<tt>3. g3</tt>.  These aren't the only options; ChessV feels white gets
compensation for the f pawn if the gambit <tt>3. e4!?</tt> is 
played.  
<p>

An analysis using ChessV of the positions obtained after both
<tt>3. e3</tt> and <tt>3. g3</tt> indicates that e3 is better; 
while white has more mobility with his kingside bishop after
g3, this blocks the key square for his kingside knight and opens
white's kingside bishop to harassment should black play Bb6.
Here is the position after white defends with e3:

<p>
<img src="sibahi02.png">
<br>
<i>The position after 1. f4 c6 2. Nd3 Bc7 3. e3</i>
<p>

Another way black can continue the Sibahi Defense after <tt>2. Nd3</tt>
is to have a Sicilian setup with <tt>2. ... d6</tt>.  White's best
reply, at this point, looks to be <tt>3. Ng3</tt>, which results
in the following position:

<p>
<img src="sibahi03.png">
<br>
<i>The position after 1. f4 c6 2. Nd3 d5 3. Ng3</i>
<p>

Should black now apply more pressure on the f pawn with Bc7, white
can reply with the e3 defense.
