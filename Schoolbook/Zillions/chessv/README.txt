These are rule definition files for ChessV 0.9, which allow ChessV to
play three of the variants included with the Zillions file.

While ChessV has native Schoolbook support, the schoolbook.sgf file allows
one to easily change the piece values (or setup) if desired.

schoolbook-upsidedown.sgf allows on to play "Upside-down Schoolbook".

schoolbook-shantraj.sgf allows one to play "Schoolbook Shantraj".

To add these files to the list of games ChessV supports, add these
files to the ChessV\Include directory.
