In the late 1980s, Kasparov insisted that a computer could 
not defeat the Chess world champion because "computers have 
no soul".  Computers may or may not have souls, but by 1997 
a computer was able to defeat Kasparov in a Chess match with 
traditional time controls.  Indeed, while computers play Chess 
differently than humans, thriving on complicated tactics far 
more than any sane human, they are perfectly capable of 
creating pretty positions.

<p>

This is especially true in highly tactical chess variants.
In the following game of Schoolbook chess, Zillions had the 
white pieces and ChessV had the black pieces, with both sides 
playing fives seconds a move:

<p>
<b>
1. Af3	f5	
2. Nd3	Ng6
3. Ng3 	f4
4. Nh5	c6
5. Ag5
</b>
<p>

Here we see that Zillions prefers to bring pieces out before
pawns, and that Zillions has no qualms with moving the same
piece twice in the opening.  Indeed, ChessV almost always
defeats Zillions when both sides have the same amount of time
to think.

<p>
<b>
5. ...	h6
6. Af3	I6
7. NI3	e5
8. Nc5 	Be7
9. b4
</b>
<p>

Zillions finally advances a pawn.

<p>
<b>
9. ...	d6
10.Ne4	Nh4
11.Ag4	h5
12.AI5	Ng6
13.Ah3	d5
14.Nc5	Nb6
</b>
<p>

White now forces Black to move his king.

<p>
<b>
15. Ne6	Kf7
16. Ng5	Kf6
17. c4	Nh4
</b>
<p>

<p>

In 17 moves, white has only moved three pieces and two pawns.
Despite this, he has won the game.  White can now move and 
force mate; finding this mate is left as an exercise 
for the reader.
