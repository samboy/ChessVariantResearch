In the late 1980s, Kasparov insisted that a computer could 
not defeat the Chess world champion because "computers have 
no soul".  Computers may or may not have souls, but by 1997 
a computer was able to defeat Kasparov in a Chess match with 
traditional time controls.  Indeed, while computers play Chess 
differently than humans, thriving on complicated tactics far 
more than any sane human, they are perfectly capable of 
creating pretty positions.

<p>

This is especially true in highly tactical chess variants.
In the following game of Schoolbook chess, Zillions had the 
white pieces and ChessV had the black pieces, with both sides 
playing fives seconds a move:

<p>
<b>
1. Af3	f5	
2. Nd3	Ng6
3. Ng3 	f4
4. Nh5	c6
5. Ag5
</b>
<p>

Here we see that Zillions prefers to bring pieces out before
pawns, and that Zillions has no qualms with moving the same
piece twice in the opening.  Indeed, ChessV almost always
defeats Zillions when both sides have the same amount of time
to think.

<p>
<b>
5. ...	h6
6. Af3	I6
7. NI3	e5
8. Nc5 	Be7
9. b4
</b>
<p>

Zillions finally advances a pawn.

<p>
<b>
9. ...	d6
10.Ne4	Nh4
11.Ag4	h5
12.AI5	Ng6
13.Ah3	d5
14.Nc5	Nb6
</b>
<p>

White now forces Black to move his king.

<p>
<b>
15. Ne6	Kf7
16. Ng5	Kf6
17. c4	Nh4
</b>
<p>

<p>

In 17 moves, white has only moved three pieces and two pawns.
Despite this, he has won the game.  White can now move and 
force mate; finding this mate is left as an exercise 
for the reader.

<p>

Now that I have shown you a game where Zillions wins against ChessV, I will
now show you an example of the much more common case of ChessV winning 
against Zillions.  In this game, Zillions was again white and ChessV 
was black.  Both sides were given 60 seconds to think their move:

<p>
<b>
1. Af3 Nd6
2. Ng3 f5
3. Nd3 Nhf7
4. h3 e6
5. BI3 h6
6. Ah5 Bh7
7. Ke1?
</b>
<p>
Zillions, for mysterious reasons, made a meaningless king move.
<p>
<b>
7. ... I6
8. Af3 MI7
9. Bxd8 Qxd8
10. Nc5 Ng5
11. Ae5 Ndf7
12. Ad4 Ad6
13. Mj3 Qe7
</b>
<p>
ChessV now has Zillions on the run.  With a better pawn structure
and two more pieces developed, black has more than equalized and 
now controls the game.
<p>
<b>
14. Nd3 
</b>
<p>
<img src="60sec-diagram.png">
<p>
At this point, Black can force the win of a piece.  The moves
to do so are left as an exercise for the reader.
