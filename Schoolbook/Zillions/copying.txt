The Schoolbook-b.zrf and Schoolbook-compat.zrf files are encumbered by 
whatever copyright the chess.zrf that Zillions-of-games comes with has.

The Schoolbook-a.zrf file is encumbered by both whatever copyright
Mats Winther imposes on his modifications to the chess.zrf file that
he has made, and the copyright the chess.zrf that Zillions-of-games 
comes with has.

The Knight image, and the derived Marshall and Archbishop images,
were obtained from the Skak TeX font (a Chess diagram font
for Chess), which has the following copyright notice:

This package is distributed under the terms described in the Latex
Project Public Licence, i.e.,    

  This software is copyright but you are granted a license which gives
  you, the "user" of the software, legal permission to copy,
  distribute, and/or modify the software. However, if you modify the
  software and then distribute it (even just locally) you must change
  the name of the software to avoid confusion.

For the purposes of "the name of the software", I have placed the
"Schoolbook" prefix before the names of the pieces using these symbols,
which presumably needs to be changed if the graphics are ever modified by
someone besides myself.

All of the files in the alfaeire/ directory are under a restrictive
copyright.  In more detail, these images are derived from David Howe's
alfaeir graphics, which have no stated copyright.  The alfaerie graphics,
in turn, are based on renderings of characters in Eric Bentzen's Chess 
Alpha font, which "is free for personal non commercial use."

All other files are released to the public domain.
