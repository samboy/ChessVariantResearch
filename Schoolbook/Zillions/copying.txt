The Schoolbook-b.zrf and Schoolbook-compat.zrf files are encumbered by 
whatever copyright the chess.zrf that Zillions-of-games comes with has.

The Schoolbook-a.zrf file is encumbered by both whatever copyright
Mats Winther imposes on his modifications to the chess.zrf file that
he has made, and the copyright the chess.zrf that Zillions-of-games 
comes with has.

All of the files in the alfaeire/ directory are under a restrictive
copyright in some jurisdictions.

In more detail, these images are derived from David Howe's
alfaerie graphics, which have no stated copyright, but can
not be copyright protected in the United States as per
*Eltra Corp. v. Ringer*.

The alfaerie graphics, in turn, are based on renderings of characters in 
Eric Bentzen's Chess Alpha font, which "is free for personal non 
commercial use."  Note that, since the glyphs are raster images,
and since fonts (which, yes, includes chess piece image fonts; see
*Eltra Corp. v. Ringer*) do not have copyright in the United States,
these images are not encumbered by Bentzen's copyright in the US.  
*Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc.* does not apply here.

All other files are released to the public domain.
