Let’s look at symmetrical fairy chess pieces:

```
   DED
   C.C
   BAB
```

The following patterns are non-colorbound (a piece with the pattern can
go to any square on the board; X means the piece can move that way):

```
ABCDE
.X..X 
.C.C. (Bishop; colorbound)
.X.XX (Silver or Silverrider)
.XX.X 
.XXX. (Free boar)
.XXXX
X..X.
X..XX (Copper or white horse)
X.X.X (Rook)
X.XX.
X.XXX (Gold/Goldrider)
XX..X
XX.X.
XX.XX (Flying Ox)
XXX.X
XXXX.
XXXXX (Queen or commoner)
```

So:

(An “attacker” form has the same or more forward than backward vectors;
 these will be marked with *)

* 2 directions, 2/1 forms (BE and AD*)
* 3 directions, 8/5 forms (BDE*, BCE, BCD*, ADE*, ACE*, ACD*, ABE, ABD) 
* 4 directions, 4/2 forms (BCDE*, ACDE, ABDE*, ABCD)
* 5 directions, 1 form (ABCDE*) 

So, 9 forms we have here.  18 if we have one-square movers then riders
(a commoner -- non-royal king -- is a one-square mover; a queen is a rider)

And this has not looked at combinations of movers and riders (such as the
Dragon Horse -- bishop + commoner -- and dragon king -- rook + commoner).

Some more non-colorbound movers:

* The knight
* Knight + fers (fers is one square like a bishop)
* Knight + wazir (wazir is one square like a rook)
* Knight + alfil (alfil: Leaps 2 squares like a bishop)
* Knight + dabbaba (dabbaba: Leaps 2 squares like a rook)
* The crab (Half-knight: From E4, goes to D6, F6, C3, and G3)
* Crab + fers
* Crab + wazir
* Crab + alfil
* Crab + dabbaba
* Knight + any of the nine movers above (8 more, we already have wazir)
* Crab + any of the nine movers above (8 more, we already have wazir)
* Rook + knight
* Bishop + knight
* Knight + any of the nine riders above (8 more, we already have rook)
* Rook + crab
* Bishop + crab
* Crab + any of the nine riders above (8 more, we already have rook)

Point being, we can easily come up with 32 different type of 
non-colorbound fairy Chess pieces.  Probably 64 if we work at it a
little more, but let’s make it 32.

# More than 960

Why settle for only 960 setups.

Bobby Fischer proposed Chess960, which is Chess with 960 opening setups.

As it turns out, about two thirds of those setups give White less of an
edge than RNBQKBNR “normal” Chess.  Some of them may be more drawish, but
maybe not: Chess itself is a draw, and our storngest computers are
strong enough that we get results like “100 games played, 100 draws” if
we do not force computers to play unbalanced openings.

Point being, we have about 600 setups which look to make an opening
setup as rich as the one Chess itself has.

But, we can do better than that.

Let’s take an 8x8 board.  Lets allow each piece, besides the king and
pawns, to be one of 32 pieces (pawns always promote to chess Queen in 
this variant).  We can have multiples of a given type of piece.

To formalize it, let’s list 32 piece types:

1. Rook: Slides N, S, E, and W
2. White Horse (from Chu Shogi): Slides NW, N, NE, and S
3. Knight: Leaps two squares, like a “L”: N+NW, N+NE, S+SW, S+SE, E+NE, E+NW,
   W+NW, and W+SW
4. Knight + Fers: Like a knight, but also moves one square NW, NE, SW, and SE
5. Knight + Wazir: Like a knight, but also moves N, S, E, and W
6. Knight + Alfil: Like a knight, but also leaps two squares like a bishop:
   NW+NW, NE+NE, SW+SW, and SE+SE
7. Knight + Dabbaba: Like a knight, but also leaps two squares like a rook:
   N+N, S+S, E+E, W+W
8. Commoner: Like a King, but not royal: N, S, E, W, NW, NE, SW, and SE
9. Commoner + Alfil: Like a commoner, but also leaps NW+NW, NE+NE, SW+SW, and
   SE+SE
10. Commoner + Dabbaba: Like a commoner, but also leaps N+N, S+S, E+E, and 
    W+W
11. Y slider: Slides NW, NE, and S
12. Sliver: Fers + can move one square forward: NW, N, NE, SW, and SE
13. Silverrider: Like a silver, but slides NW, N, NE, SW, and SE
14. Gold: Wazir + forward like a Fers: NW, N, NE, W, E, and S
15. Goldrider: Like a gold, but slides NW, N, NE, W, E, and S
16. Dragon Horse: Bishop + Commoner: Slides NW, NE, SW, and SE.  Moves
    one square N, S, E, and W
17. Dragon King: Rook + Commoner: Slides N, S, E, and W.  Moves one
    square NW, NE, SW, and SE
18. Crab: Half knight.  Leaps N+NW, N+NE, W+SW, and E+SE.  From E4, it
    can go to D6, F6, C3, and G3
19. Crab + Fers: Leaps N+NW, N+NE, W+SW, E+SE.  Moves one square NW, NE,
    SW, and SE
19. Crab + Wazir: Leaps N+NW, N+NE, W+SW, E+SE.  Moves one square N, S,
    E, and W
20. Crab + Alfil: Leaps N+NW, N+NE, W+SW, E+SE, NW+NW, NE+NE, SW+SW, and 
    SE+SE
21. Crab + Dabbaba: Leaps N+NW, N+NE, W+SW, E+SE, N+N, S+S, E+E, and W+W
22. Archbishop: Knight + Bishop
23. Marshall: Knight + Rook
24. Queen: Slides N, S, E, W, NW, NE, SW, and SE
25. Centaur: Knight + Commoner
26. Flying Ox: Slides N, NE, SE, S, SW, and NW
27. Free Boar: Slides NW, NE, E, SW, SE, and W
28. VT mover: Moves one square NW, NE, W, E, and S
29. VT slider: Slides NW, NE, W, E, and S
30. Crabby Rook: Rook + Crab
31. Crabby Bishop: Bishop + Crab
32. Crabby Commoner: Commoner + Crab

For castling, the king can swap positions with another piece, if the
piece is at least 3 pieces away, there are no pieces in the way,
and the king does not jump over a piece under attack.

That in mind, we have 34,359,738,368 different possible opening setups.

For a 10x8 board, we have 35,184,372,088,832 possible opening setups.

Let’s call these variants Chess34359738368 and Chess35184372088832.
