Diagonal moves on the Turtle Shell board are a judgment call, which is
why the main variants of Turtle Shell (either with or without a cardinal)
do not have a diagonal move.  

The simplified rule is that the diagonal moves forward are the two knight
moves with the most forward vertical movement, and the diagonal moves
backwards are the two knight moves with the most backwards vertical
movement.  In addition, some effort is made to have a diagonal move
change the file one is on, except where that would eliminate a
diagonal move (such as on E6).

The full rules are below:

For the purposes of determining diagonal connections, we use
the illustration of files for Rook moves, which shows the following 
six files:

B0-B1-B3-A3-A4-A5-A6-B6-B7-B9
C0-C1-B2-C2-C3-C4-B5-C5-C6-C7-B8-C8-C9
D0-E1-D2-D2-E2-D3-D5-D6-E7-D7-D8-E8-D9
E0-E1-D2-D2-E2-E3-E5-E6-E7-D7-D8-E8-E9 
F0-F1-G2-F2-F3-F4-G5-F5-G6-F7-G8-F8-F9
G0-G1-G3-H3-H4-H5-H6-G6-G7-G9

In addition, we have two more files when determining if a connection
is diagonal

A3-A4-A5-A6
H3-H4-H5-H6

We have the first connections be NW-NE-SW-SE using the following rules:

NW:
1) Look at all of the possible knight moves from a given cell
2) If the cell occupies one file, move left (west) one file like a rook.  
3) Only if one is in a cell that occupies two files do the following: 
   a) If step 4 has not been performed, stay in the same cell, but
      be in the leftmost file of that cell.
   b) If step 4 has already been performed, move to the file to the 
      left of the leftmost file that occupies the starting cell.
4) Look up (north) the file and see if there are any possible knight
   move destinations.  If not (e.g. D1 or D7), go back to step 3.
5) Go up (north) this file until one is in the highest (most north)
   possible cell which is a knight move away from the starting cell.
6) Make that cell the NW knight move from the starting cell.

NE, SW, and SE are similar, but I will spell them out for the sake of 
clarity:

NE:
1) Look at all of the possible knight moves from a given cell
2) If the cell occupies one file, move right (east) one file like a rook.  
3) Only if one is in a cell that occupies two files do the following: 
   a) If step 4 has not been performed, stay in the same cell, but
      be in the rightmost file of that cell.
   b) If step 4 has already been performed, move to the file to the 
      right of the rightmost file that occupies the starting cell.
4) Look up (north) the file and see if there are any possible knight
   move destinations.  If not (e.g. D1 or D7), go back to step 3.
5) Go up (north) this file until one is in the highest (most north)
   possible cell which is a knight move away from the starting cell.
6) Make that cell the NE knight move from the starting cell.

SW:
1) Look at all of the possible knight moves from a given cell
2) If the cell occupies one file, move left (west) one file like a rook.  
3) Only if one is in a cell that occupies two files do the following: 
   a) If step 4 has not been performed, stay in the same cell, but
      be in the leftmost file of that cell.
   b) If step 4 has already been performed, move to the file to the 
      left of the leftmost file that occupies the starting cell.
4) Look down (south) the file and see if there are any possible knight
   move destinations.  If not (e.g. D2 or D8), go back to step 3.
5) Go down (south) this file until one is in the lowest (most south)
   possible cell which is a knight move away from the starting cell.
6) Make that cell the SW knight move from the starting cell.

SE:
1) Look at all of the possible knight moves from a given cell
2) If the cell occupies one file, move right (east) one file like a rook.  
3) Only if one is in a cell that occupies two files do the following: 
   a) If step 4 has not been performed, stay in the same cell, but
      be in the rightmost file of that cell.
   b) If step 4 has already been performed, move to the file to the 
      right of the rightmost file that occupies the starting cell.
4) Look down (south) the file and see if there are any possible knight
   move destinations.  If not (e.g. D2 or D8), go back to step 3.
5) Go down (south) this file until one is in the lowest (most south)
   possible cell which is a knight move away from the starting cell.
6) Make that cell the SE knight move from the starting cell.
