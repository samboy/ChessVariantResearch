This is a Zillions of Games implementation of Turtle Shell Chess, a
Chess variant that is played on a tessellation called the “33344-33434 
tiling.”  Full rules for this variant are in the file TurtleShell.pdf.

To play, go to https://zillions-of-games.com/, download and install
the program, then, as needed, make a donation to get the unlock key; 
there is no set price so the donation amount is based on one's income
and what one can reasonably afford to spend.

Zillions runs well in Windows 10, and is playable in x86 Linux with 
Wine.

Note that the Zillions implementation does not correctly implement
Turtle Shell Chess's "No chasing" rules; instead, a repetition is
a loss for the person who repeats a given position for the third
time.
