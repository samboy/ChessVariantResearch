Some other pieces besides the pieces in official Turtle Shell Chess:

* Horizontal Circle rider.  Fairly powerful when combined with
  a vertical rook.  See 64-square-1-circle3.png and 64-square-1-circle4.png
  for the paths in a horizontal circle.  Akin to Betza’s rose.
* Vertical circle rider.  Like the horizontal mover, but moves in the
  circles shown in 64-square-1-circle1.png and 64-square-1-circle2.png
* Hybrid knight/guard: Moves like a guard on square tiles; moves like
  a knight on triangle tiles.
* Double move guard: Moves like a guard, but twice in one turn.  Slightly
  more powerful than a knight.
* Semi-Cardinal: Moves like a rook when on a triangle tile.  Moves like
  a knight when on a sqaure tile.
* Limited Cardinal (Archibishop, perhaps): Moves like a rook or, when
  on triangle tiles, like a rook or knight.
* Sideways pawns: Allow pawns to move one square sideways without 
  capturing.  Probably makes it a completely new game, just as
  sideways pawns in normal western chess make for a very different
  game.

Note that there really isn’t a “diagonal” because each vertex (corner,
if you will) touches five tiles, so we don’t have a Bishop.  On the
other hand, with both triangles and squares, we can have hybrid pieces,
and we can also have circle movers without needing a huge board the way
a Betza Rose does.
