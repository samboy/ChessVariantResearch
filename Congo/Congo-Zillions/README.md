Included here are the files required to play Congo (and the simple megapawn
mod) with Zillions of Games.  

To make a file, congo-megapawn.tar.gz, run the script
`make.simple.megapawn.sh` using Bash.  Note that the `unzip` program 
needs to be installed to run this shell script.

Changes from stock Congo:

* A1/B1 and F1/G1 have islands: One will not drown on these squares.

If one selects the variant, the following changes are also done:

* The pawns are now “mPawns”: Once after the river, they can *not* go
  backwards, but can more or capture one square forwards or sideways.

* When a pawn promotes, it becomes a “megapawn”: It may move or capture
  any space within two squares.  This way, like Chess, a pawn promotion
  will usually be a win for the player with the promoted pawn.

* The opening setup has been changed to one which is more like Chinese
  Chess and which can be played using an ordinary Chess board and pieces.
