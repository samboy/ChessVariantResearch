In the game of [Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_(chess_variant)),
there have been [complaints](https://www.chessvariants.com/index/listcomments.php?order=DESC&itemid=Congo) 
that the game is too drawish.

Indeed, the game inventors are open to Congo variants that are less
drawish.

That in mind, I am working on a less drawish version of Congo which
has more active play, by using some of the same lessons learned
by the inventors of Chinese Chess:

* Repetition is a loss, not a draw

* Have fewer pawns so the armies can engage each other better

* Have the pawn move sideways on the other side of the river

And, in addition, a lesson learned by the inventors of ordinary Chess:

* Have the pawn promote to a powerful piece

In addition, the variants I am working on can be played with ordinary
Chess pieces and Chess board (by reducing the types of pieces from
standard Congo) and the rules are easier to learn.

# Thoughts on Congo

The reason why Congo only has one of each piece is because it’s designed
to be played with a two sets of animal dolls, where one usually only gets
one kind of each animal.

Since the animal dolls have various colors, and the player playing an 
animal is determined by the way the animal faces, one way to get
rid of draws is to simply add Shogi-style drops.

In my experience, weakening the river and adding a “Ko” (no
repetition) rule gets rid of the draws and makes play less passive.

# Four piece endgames

Once in a few games, one will end up with a lion-and-piece
vs. lion-and-same-piece “Ko fight” where the winner is the one
who forces the other player to make a losing move to avoid repetition.
While this does ultimately result in a decisive result, remembering what
positions one had before and defeating the other player for repeating
one of them is more like Husker Du than like Chess.

One idea to stop these 4-piece endgames is to have a rule that any
player who makes a move which results in there being a four piece
endgame, where both players have the same non-lion piece, loses.

# Magic river variant

Another idea is to make the river a “magic river”:  Any piece
which is able to stay in the river for more than one turn is able
to move to any empty square on the board.  This teleportation would
take the place of another move made by the player.

Options include: Teleportation is mandatory (even if one then loses
their lion), teleportation is optional, but a piece which does not
teleport is drowned, or teleportation is optional and can be done
as long as the player has been in the river for more than one turn.
