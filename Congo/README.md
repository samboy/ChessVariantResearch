In the game of [Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_(chess_variant)),
there have been [complaints](https://www.chessvariants.com/index/listcomments.php?order=DESC&itemid=Congo) 
that the game is too drawish.

Indeed, the game inventors are open to Congo variants that are less
drawish.

That in mind, I am working on a less drawish version of Congo which
has more active play, by using some of the same lessons learned
by the inventors of Chinese Chess:

* Repetition is a loss, not a draw

* Have fewer pawns so the armies can engage each other better

* Have the pawn move sideways on the other side of the river

And, in addition, a lesson learned by the inventors of ordinary Chess:

* Have the pawn promote to a powerful piece

In addition, the variants I am working on can be played with ordinary
Chess pieces and Chess board (by reducing the types of pieces from
standard Congo) and the rules are easier to learn.
